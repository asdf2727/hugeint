    Get ideas form other implementations like this one: https://faheel.github.io/BigInt/
    examples:
        add more operators to the arithmetic calculator
    clean the code:
        make both constructor and assignment have difrent code
    features:
        add parsing for string conversion to allow for things like 0x..., b..., x..., etc.
        implement square root
        implicit conversions and warnings for them
 	faster algorithms:
 		decimal to hex and inverse casting
 		    divide and conquer
 		division
 		    see if there even is an algorithm
 		multiplication
 		    add simple multiplication for small * big
 		    if you have and sanity left try Schonhage-Strassen: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage%E2%80%93Strassen_algorithm
