# TODO

Get ideas form other implementations like this one: https://faheel.github.io/BigInt/

### examples:

- [x] add ^ to the example calulator

### features:

- [x] repair octa output
- [x] redo example
- [ ] add ' inside number reading
- [x] add index for broken character for "fromString"
- [ ] make the library header-only
- [x] add parsing for string conversion to allow for things like 0x..., b..., x..., etc.
- [ ] implement nth root

### faster algorithms:

- [ ] decimal to hex and inverse casting
  divide and conquer
- [ ] division

    - see if there even is an algorithm

- [ ] multiplication

    - add simple multiplication for small * big
    - if you have any sanity left try
      Schonhage-Strassen: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage%E2%80%93Strassen_algorithm

### to test:

- [x] test index for broken character in "fromString"
- [ ] example (especially both powers and more paranthesis)

### where to publish:

- [ ] reddit
- [ ] hackernews
