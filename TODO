TODO:
    Get ideas form other implementations like this one: https://faheel.github.io/BigInt/
    examples:
        add more operators to the arithmetic calculator
    clean the code:
        instead of always copying a variable, make a pointer that can modify when needed (node: tostring, *=, /=, %=)
        make both constructor and assignment have difrent code
        put inline to internal functions without a compiler error
    features:
        add parsing for string conversion to allow for things like 0x, b, x, etc.
        add sensical % operator (with all positive modulo)
        implement square root
        implement power modulo
        implicit conversions and warnings for them
 	faster algorithms:
 		decimal to hex and inverse casting
 		division
 		multiplication
	to test:
 		all
