TODO:
    clean the code:
        default = operator for hugeint ot hugeint
        instead of always copying a variable, make a pointer that can modify when needed (node: tostring, *=, /=, %=)
        make both constructor and assignment have difrent code
        put inline to internal functions without a compiler error
    features:
        make toString public
        add parsing for string conversion to allow for things like 0x, b, x, etc.
        return the size in bytes
        add sensical % operator (with all positive modulo)
        implement square root
        implicit conversions and warnings for them
