# hugeint
A C++ class that adds arbitrary precision integers with high performance that is very easily integrated into any project.
All you need to do is replace hugeint with int in the declaration and the rest is done for you!

It has all operators that are usable with a normal integer type, and I mean ALL of them.

    -asignment functions: =, constuctors and casting operators for any integer type
    -comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=;
    -bit operators: ~, &=, &, |=, |, ^=, ^, <<=, <<, >>=, >>;
    -adition and subtraction operators: ++ and --(both pre and post increment), +=, +, -=, -;
    -multiplication and division operators: *=, *, /=, /, %=, %;
    -iostream input and output operators: <<, >>.

All these operators function identicaly to the int type, but without overflow at any size.

I am consistently working on this project, and I have a TODO file in which you can look to better see what are my curent improvment goals.

All sugestions are highly apreciated, you can share them
